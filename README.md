## I. Introduction

A quine is a non-empty computer program which takes no input and produces a copy of its
own source code as its only output. Opening the source file and displaying
it is considered cheating.

## II. Mandatory Part

- **Colleen:**

    The first program, `Colleen`, is a quine that prints its own source code in `tmp_Colleen`.

- **Grace:**

    The second program, `Grace`, is a quine that writes its own source code in `Grace_kid.c`.
    `Grace.c` must only use #define macros.

- **Sully:**

    The third program, `Sully`, is a quine that writes its own source code in `Sully_X.c`. It compiles and executes `Sully_X.c` as long as ```X > 0```.
